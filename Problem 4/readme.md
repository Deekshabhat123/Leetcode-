Explanation
Merge and Sort:

Merge nums1 and nums2 into one list and then sort it. This ensures that the merged list is sorted.
Length Calculation:

Compute the length n of the merged list.
Median Calculation:

If the length n is odd, the median is the middle element, which is directly accessed.
If the length n is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. Note that you need to divide by 2.0 to ensure the result is a float.
