This condition:

```python
rev < (-2**31) // 10 or (rev == (-2**31) // 10 and pop > 8)
```

is intended to prevent overflow when reversing a 32-bit signed integer in case of a negative number. Let's break it down:

### **Understanding 32-bit signed integers:**
- A 32-bit signed integer has a range of `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1` (or `-2147483648` to `2147483647`).
- If you try to reverse a number and exceed this range, it results in an overflow.

### **Components of the Condition:**

1. **`rev < (-2**31) // 10`**
   - This checks if the current value of `rev` (before adding the next digit) is about to overflow when multiplied by 10.
   - When reversing an integer, each new digit is added by multiplying the current `rev` by 10 and adding the last digit (`pop`). Before doing this operation, the code checks whether multiplying `rev` by 10 would push it past the lower bound of a 32-bit signed integer.
   - `(-2**31) // 10` gives the threshold beyond which multiplying by 10 will overflow the negative 32-bit integer range. This threshold is `-214748364`, which is the largest number you can multiply by 10 without crossing the boundary for negative integers.

2. **`(rev == (-2**31) // 10 and pop > 8)`**
   - This part checks the case where `rev` is exactly equal to `-214748364` (the threshold), and you're about to append the next digit (`pop`). If `pop` is greater than 8, adding it would result in a number smaller than `-2147483648`, which is beyond the lower bound for a 32-bit signed integer.
   - The maximum allowable value for the last digit in this case is 8 because the most negative number in a 32-bit system is `-2147483648`. So, if `rev == -214748364` and `pop` is greater than 8, the result will be smaller than `-2147483648` and thus overflow.

### **Why this check is unnecessary for positive numbers:**
In the context of the code you've provided earlier, the overflow check for positive numbers (using the range `2^31 - 1` or `2147483647`) is sufficient. This specific negative check is redundant because you're already reversing the absolute value of the number (`x = abs(x)`), so the result will only be multiplied by `-1` at the end.

### Example of Overflow for Negative Numbers:
If `x = -8463847412`, the reversed number would be `-2147483648`, which is the exact lower limit for a 32-bit signed integer. However, if `x = -8463847413`, the reverse would result in `-2147483649`, which would overflow.

---

### **Summary:**
The condition:

```python
rev < (-2**31) // 10 or (rev == (-2**31) // 10 and pop > 8)
```

checks if reversing a negative number would cause an overflow beyond the limit of `-2^31`. Specifically:
- `rev < (-2**31) // 10` ensures that multiplying `rev` by 10 doesn't cause an overflow.
- `rev == (-2**31) // 10 and pop > 8` ensures that appending the last digit doesn't make the result smaller than `-2147483648`. 

In the case of reversing the absolute value (as in your code), this specific check becomes unnecessary, which is why it can be removed.
