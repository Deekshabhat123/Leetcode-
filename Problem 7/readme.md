This condition:

```python
rev < (-2**31) // 10 or (rev == (-2**31) // 10 and pop > 8)
```

is intended to prevent overflow when reversing a 32-bit signed integer in case of a negative number. Let's break it down:

### **Understanding 32-bit signed integers:**
- A 32-bit signed integer has a range of `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1` (or `-2147483648` to `2147483647`).
- If you try to reverse a number and exceed this range, it results in an overflow.

### **Components of the Condition:**

1. **`rev < (-2**31) // 10`**
   - This checks if the current value of `rev` (before adding the next digit) is about to overflow when multiplied by 10.
   - When reversing an integer, each new digit is added by multiplying the current `rev` by 10 and adding the last digit (`pop`). Before doing this operation, the code checks whether multiplying `rev` by 10 would push it past the lower bound of a 32-bit signed integer.
   - `(-2**31) // 10` gives the threshold beyond which multiplying by 10 will overflow the negative 32-bit integer range. This threshold is `-214748364`, which is the largest number you can multiply by 10 without crossing the boundary for negative integers.

2. **`(rev == (-2**31) // 10 and pop > 8)`**
   - This part checks the case where `rev` is exactly equal to `-214748364` (the threshold), and you're about to append the next digit (`pop`). If `pop` is greater than 8, adding it would result in a number smaller than `-2147483648`, which is beyond the lower bound for a 32-bit signed integer.
   - The maximum allowable value for the last digit in this case is 8 because the most negative number in a 32-bit system is `-2147483648`. So, if `rev == -214748364` and `pop` is greater than 8, the result will be smaller than `-2147483648` and thus overflow.

### **Why this check is unnecessary for positive numbers:**
In the context of the code you've provided earlier, the overflow check for positive numbers (using the range `2^31 - 1` or `2147483647`) is sufficient. This specific negative check is redundant because you're already reversing the absolute value of the number (`x = abs(x)`), so the result will only be multiplied by `-1` at the end.

### Example of Overflow for Negative Numbers:
If `x = -8463847412`, the reversed number would be `-2147483648`, which is the exact lower limit for a 32-bit signed integer. However, if `x = -8463847413`, the reverse would result in `-2147483649`, which would overflow.

### **Summary:**
The condition:

```python
rev < (-2**31) // 10 or (rev == (-2**31) // 10 and pop > 8)
```

checks if reversing a negative number would cause an overflow beyond the limit of `-2^31`. Specifically:
- `rev < (-2**31) // 10` ensures that multiplying `rev` by 10 doesn't cause an overflow.
- `rev == (-2**31) // 10 and pop > 8` ensures that appending the last digit doesn't make the result smaller than `-2147483648`. 

In the case of reversing the absolute value (as in your code), this specific check becomes unnecessary, which is why it can be removed
The use of `abs(x)` in your code serves a key purpose: it simplifies handling the reversal process by focusing only on the positive digits of the number, regardless of whether the input number is positive or negative. Here's why:

### **Purpose of `abs(x)`**:
1. **Reversing without worrying about the sign**:
   - When reversing an integer, the only thing that matters is the digits. For example, both `123` and `-123` have the same digits, but differ in sign.
   - By using `abs(x)`, you remove the sign and can focus on manipulating the digits. Once the digits are reversed, you can easily apply the original sign back at the end.

2. **Consistency in overflow checks**:
   - When using `abs(x)`, you're always working with positive numbers, which makes the overflow checks simpler. Since both positive and negative overflow conditions are similar (but reversed in sign), working with positive numbers simplifies the logic and ensures that the checks don't need to be handled separately for both positive and negative numbers.
   - After the number is reversed, the original sign can be applied (using `rev * sign`), and you can determine if the result is in range for a 32-bit signed integer.

### **Why `abs(x)` is used in the original code**:
- **If `x` is negative**: By calling `x = abs(x)`, the negative sign is removed, and you're left with a positive number to reverse.
- **After reversing**: The original sign is stored in the variable `sign` using `sign = -1 if x < 0 else 1`. After reversing the digits, you multiply `rev` by `sign` to restore the original sign, like so: `rev * sign`.

### Example Without `abs(x)`:
If you didn't use `abs(x)` and directly tried to reverse a negative number (e.g., `-123`), you'd have to keep track of the negative sign separately. You'd need to ensure that the remainder of negative divisions and modulus operations behave as expected, which can add complexity and require extra logic.

### Example of How `abs(x)` Helps:

Let's see what happens with `x = -123`:

1. **With `abs(x)`**:
   - `abs(-123)` gives `123`, and you reverse the digits of `123` as usual: `321`.
   - Finally, apply the negative sign back by multiplying with `-1`, giving `-321`.

2. **Without `abs(x)`**:
   - You would need to handle the negative sign throughout the process. Each division or modulus operation involving a negative number would need extra handling, such as checking whether the current remainder is positive or negative.
   - The overflow checks would also need separate conditions for negative numbers.

By using `abs(x)`, you can avoid these complications, making the reversal process simpler and more consistent.

### **Summary**:
`abs(x)` is used to remove the sign of the number and allow the reversal process to focus solely on the digits. After reversing, the sign is applied back at the end. This approach simplifies both the reversal process and the overflow checks.
